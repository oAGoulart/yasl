YASL documentation
==================

WIP codebase is being pushed to repo as it is coded so you might not be able to compile while I write/test the code.

You'll need to use the tool WrappEm that I created to inject some payload DLL into a process.

Former Script Wrapper project. Now switching into a proper hooking module.
